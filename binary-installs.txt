# binary-installs.txt — Tools installed via official scripts or direct binaries
# Format: name|source_url|version|method
# Methods: script (curl|bash), binary (GitHub release), git (clone), npm (global install)
# Consumed by: bootstrap.sh (Phase 5) — bootstrap owns the actual install logic
#
# Version: "latest" = always get newest, "vX.Y.Z+" = minimum version required
# Post-install annotations tell bootstrap what setup is needed after install
# Auth annotations indicate tools requiring manual login after install
