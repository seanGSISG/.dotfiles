# Agent Command Center

Primary workspace for Claude Code sessions and development orchestration.

## Workspace Map

Full workspace structure on this machine:

- **~/projects/** — Active development projects and code repositories
- **~/labs/** — Experiments, tutorials, PoCs, throwaway prototypes
- **~/tools/** — Personal scripts, helper CLIs, developer utilities
- **~/tmp/** — Disposable scratch space (safe to wipe anytime)
- **~/command-center/** — This directory (agent command center)

## Scope of Access

Claude Code may operate within all workspace folders listed above. Each workspace has its own CLAUDE.md boundary file defining specific rules.

## Learning System

Continuous learning v2 is active on this machine:

- **Observations:** Captured to {{ .chezmoi.homeDir }}/.claude/insights/observations.jsonl
- **Instincts:** Stored in {{ .chezmoi.homeDir }}/.claude/insights/instincts/personal/
- **Commands:** Use /instinct-status to view learned patterns
- **Evolution:** Use /evolve to cluster instincts into skills

The learning system captures tool use patterns through PreToolUse and PostToolUse hooks, storing observations as JSONL events. Over time, patterns emerge as instincts with confidence scores (0.3-0.9).

## Safety Rules

- Never touch secrets, credentials, tokens, or private keys
- Never modify files outside workspace folders without explicit permission
- Never delete user files without confirmation
- Always respect boundary files in each workspace

## Development Workflow

This command center serves as the primary location for:

- Launching Claude Code sessions
- Coordinating work across multiple workspaces
- Reviewing learned instincts and patterns
- Managing cross-project tasks
