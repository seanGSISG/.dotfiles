# Agent Command Center

Primary workspace for Claude Code sessions and development orchestration.

## Workspace Map

Full workspace structure on this machine:

- **~/projects/** — Active development projects and code repositories
- **~/labs/** — Experiments, tutorials, PoCs, throwaway prototypes
- **~/tools/** — Personal scripts, helper CLIs, developer utilities
- **~/tmp/** — Disposable scratch space (safe to wipe anytime)
- **~/command-center/** — This directory (agent command center)

## Scope of Access

Claude Code may operate within all workspace folders listed above. Each workspace has its own CLAUDE.md boundary file defining specific rules.

## Safety Rules

- Never touch secrets, credentials, tokens, or private keys
- Never modify files outside workspace folders without explicit permission
- Never delete user files without confirmation
- Always respect boundary files in each workspace

## Development Workflow

This command center serves as the primary location for:

- Launching Claude Code sessions
- Coordinating work across multiple workspaces
- Managing cross-project tasks
