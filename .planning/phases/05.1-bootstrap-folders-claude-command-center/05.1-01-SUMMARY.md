subsystem: infra
tags: [chezmoi, claude-code, workspace, dotfiles, bootstrap]

# Dependency graph
requires:
  - phase: 05-bootstrap-implementation
    provides: Bootstrap.sh script and chezmoi configuration
provides:
  - Workspace folder structure (~/projects/, ~/labs/, ~/tools/, ~/tmp/, ~/command-center/)
  - CLAUDE.md boundary files defining scope for each workspace
  - Official Claude Code installer integration in bootstrap.sh
  - Chezmoi ignore rules for runtime learning data
affects: [05.1-02, continuous-learning, workspace-management]

# Tech tracking
tech-stack:
  added: []
  patterns:
    - Workspace boundary files (CLAUDE.md) define Claude Code scope
    - Official Anthropic installer for Claude Code (not package managers)
    - Learning system runtime data excluded from chezmoi management

key-files:
  created:
    - command-center/CLAUDE.md.tmpl
    - projects/CLAUDE.md.tmpl
    - labs/CLAUDE.md.tmpl
    - tools/CLAUDE.md.tmpl
    - tmp/CLAUDE.md.tmpl
    - command-center/.keep
    - projects/.keep
    - labs/.keep
    - tools/.keep
    - tmp/.keep
  modified:
    - bootstrap.sh
    - .chezmoiignore

key-decisions:
  - "Use official Claude Code installer (claude.ai/install.sh) instead of bun/npm"
  - "Claude Code installs before chezmoi apply (ensures configs deploy after installation)"
  - "Exclude .claude/insights/ from chezmoi management (runtime-generated data)"

patterns-established:
  - "Workspace CLAUDE.md boundary files: Each workspace folder has scope-defining CLAUDE.md"
  - "Learning system data separation: chezmoi manages configs, not runtime observations/instincts"

# Phase 05.1 Plan 01: Bootstrap Folders & Claude Command Center Summary

**Workspace structure with five folders (projects, labs, tools, tmp, command-center) deployed via chezmoi templates, each with CLAUDE.md boundary files, plus official Claude Code installer integration**

## Performance

- **Duration:** 4 min
- **Started:** 2026-02-11T22:46:00Z
- **Completed:** 2026-02-11T22:50:09Z
- **Tasks:** 2
- **Files modified:** 12

## Accomplishments
- Created reproducible workspace folder structure managed by chezmoi
- Defined clear scope boundaries for Claude Code via CLAUDE.md files in each workspace
- Replaced package manager Claude Code installation with official Anthropic installer
- Excluded runtime learning data (.claude/insights/) from chezmoi management

## Task Commits

Each task was committed atomically:

1. **Task 1: Create workspace folder templates with CLAUDE.md boundary files** - `9ed08c3` (feat)
2. **Task 2: Update Claude Code installation to use official installer** - `2ec37b5` (feat)

## Files Created/Modified

Created:
- `command-center/CLAUDE.md.tmpl` - Primary command center boundary file with workspace map and learning system docs
- `projects/CLAUDE.md.tmpl` - Active development projects workspace boundary file
- `labs/CLAUDE.md.tmpl` - Experiments and prototypes workspace boundary file
- `tools/CLAUDE.md.tmpl` - Personal utilities workspace boundary file
- `tmp/CLAUDE.md.tmpl` - Temporary scratch space boundary file
- `.keep` files in each workspace (ensures chezmoi creates empty directories)

Modified:
- `bootstrap.sh` - Replaced bun/npm Claude Code installation with official installer, moved to standalone step before chezmoi apply
- `.chezmoiignore` - Added exclusion for .claude/insights/ runtime data

## Decisions Made

1. **Official installer over package managers:** Used `curl -fsSL https://claude.ai/install.sh | bash` instead of bun/npm to avoid Node.js dependency conflicts and follow Anthropic's recommended installation method
2. **Installation order:** Claude Code installs before chezmoi apply runs, ensuring the official installer completes before ~/.claude/ configs are deployed
3. **Runtime data exclusion:** Added .claude/insights/ to .chezmoiignore so learning system observations and instincts remain machine-specific and unmanaged by chezmoi

## Deviations from Plan

None - plan executed exactly as written.

## Issues Encountered

None.

## User Setup Required

None - no external service configuration required.

## Next Phase Readiness

Workspace folder structure is ready for deployment via `chezmoi apply`. Next plan (05.1-02) can proceed with deploying Claude Code configuration files (~/.claude/ directory with hooks, settings, learning system).

Key outputs available for next phase:
- Workspace folder templates in chezmoi source
- CLAUDE.md boundary files defining scope for each workspace
- Bootstrap.sh ready to install Claude Code via official installer
- .chezmoiignore configured to exclude runtime learning data
