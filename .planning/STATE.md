## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Zsh as sole primary shell (eliminate dual-shell maintenance)
- antidote over Oh My Zsh (lighter, faster, selective plugin loading)
- Starship over Powerlevel10k (p10k unmaintained, Starship actively developed)
- fnm over nvm (40x faster, Rust-based)
- chezmoi over manual symlinks (templating, secrets management, multi-machine support)
- No Homebrew on WSL2 (apt + direct binaries is cleaner)
- Secrets in age-encrypted chezmoi files (no external tool dependency)
